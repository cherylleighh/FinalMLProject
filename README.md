# Final Project for Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning

## Sleep Disorder EDA and Supervised Learning Predictive Modeling

### Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between various health, lifestyle, and demographic factors and the presence of sleep disorders. Using two datasets, **Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv** and **Health_Sleep_Statistics.csv**, we analyze key attributes such as age, gender, physical activity level, dietary habits, stress level, sleep duration, sleep quality, BMI category, blood pressure, and heart rate.

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate supervised machine learning models to predict sleep disorders based on these factors.

### Dataset Information
- **Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv**: Contains individual-level data with lifestyle and health attributes.
- **Health_Sleep_Statistics.csv**: Provides aggregated health statistics related to sleep.

### Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Visualization of key trends and correlations
   - Feature engineering and selection

2. **Modeling & Evaluation**
   - Train-test split of data
   - Application of various supervised learning models including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Random Forest
   - Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

### Results & Findings
- The project demonstrates how different features contribute to predicting sleep disorders.
- Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics.
- Feature importance is analyzed to understand the key predictors.

### Future Work
- Exploring different Machine Learning algorithms within this context.
- Improving data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Incorporating external datasets to enhance predictive accuracy.
